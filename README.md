### Back end Installation ###

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You can then run the server with `node server`. 

The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
